Quick Setup for Ext GWT 2.1.1 Samples
===========================

Note : Ext GWT 2.1.1 RTL requires GWT 2.0.3 or later and it is assumed you are using the eclipse Google web toolkit plugin for eclipse
	   and that you have also installed the plugin for firefox and ie.

STEP 1 -> Create a GWT 2.0.x project within Eclipse.

STEP 2 -> add the gxt.jar from the lib directory to your classpath.
		  a. Right click on project name in 'Package Explorer'.
		  b. Select 'Properties' from content menu.
		  c. Select 'Java Build Path'.
		  d. Select 'Libraries' tab.
		  e. Add the gxt.jar either with 'Add JARs...' or 'Add External JARs...'.
		  
		  Add GXT jar to launch configuration.
		  a. Choose Run / Open Run Dialog.
		  b. Select your appropriate launch configuration under 'Java Application'.
		  c. Select the 'Classpath' tab.
		  d. Add the gxt.jar to the classpath.		  
		  
STEP 3 -> Copy the contents of the /resources folder to 'resources' folder in your war folder.

STEP 4 -> for RTL to work you will need to include the gxt-all-rtl.css. 
		  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="resources/css/gxt-all-rtl.css">
		  If you want to be able to flip according to locale see in the samples how to do it.

STEP 4b -> If you are using Charts, add the following script to your host page.
		  <script language='javascript' src='{foldername}/flash/swfobject.js'></script>

STEP 5 -> Add the following entry to you projects module xml file.
		  <inherits name='com.extjs.gxt.ui.GXT'/>

STEP 6 -> Ext GWT requires the following doctype (quirksmode).
		  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
	  
Basically you're all set. To execute just copy the url from the Development Mode Tab into firefox or ie.

To support rtl, apart from code changes more changes were made to images. All of the RTL images are in resources/images/rtl directory. 
The gxt-all-rtl.css is a full replacement to the gxt-all.css. This css and images only support the blue theme of extjs. 

For examples you can follow the instructions in the samples sub directory.
