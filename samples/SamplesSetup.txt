Quick Setup for Ext GWT 2.1.1 Samples
===========================

Note : Ext GWT 2.1.1 RTL requires GWT 2.0.3 or later and it is assumed you are using the eclipse Google web toolkit plugin for eclipse
	   and that you have also installed the plugin for firefox and ie.

STEP 1 -> Create a GWT 2.0.x project within Eclipse. Best to call it WidgetDashboard
		  Use package name: "com.centimia.gxt.sample.widgetdashboard"
		  uncheck "Use Google App Engine"

STEP 2 -> delete all the google stuff from under the package "com.centimia.gxt.sample.widgetdashboard"

STEP 3 -> add the gxt.jar from the lib directory to your classpath.
		  a. Right click on project name in 'Package Explorer'.
		  b. Select 'Properties' from content menu.
		  c. Select 'Java Build Path'.
		  d. Select 'Libraries' tab.
		  e. Add the gxt.jar either with 'Add JARs...' or 'Add External JARs...'.
		  
STEP 4 -> under 'src', if not created, create the package "com.centimia.gxt.sample.widgetdashboard"

STEP 5 -> copy all the contents from samples/com.centimia.gxt.sample.widgetdashboard to your new project
		  "com.centimia.gxt.sample.widgetdashboard" package.

STEP 6 -> copy all the contents from samples/com.google.gwt.sample.showcase to your new project
		  "com.google.gwt.sample.showcase" package. Add the package as it does not exist.

STEP 7 -> copy all the contents from samples/com.extjs.gxt.samples to your new project
		  "com.extjs.gxt.samples" package. Add the package as it does not exist.
	  
STEP 8 -> Copy the contents of the /resources folder to 'resources' folder in your war folder.

STEP 9 -> Copy the /images directory to the war directory.

STEP 10 -> replace the WidgetDesktop.css and WidgetDesktop.html in the war directory with the corresponding files from
		  samples/war from download.

STEP 11 -> replace the web.xml file in war directory with file from samples/war/WEB-INF

STEP 12 -> GWT compile project. You only need the WidgetDashboard entry point.
	  
Basically you're all set. To execute just copy the url from the Development Mode Tab into firefox or ie. To see the screen in RTL add 
'&locale=iw' at the end of the url. Currently the samples are configured with 'iw' locale, which is a RTL locale. You can change this.

See the general Setup instructions for more information on using RTL.
